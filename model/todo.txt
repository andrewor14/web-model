This is an incomplete list of things to do to improve this model:

1. Allow custom topologies
2. Use more realistic values for latencies
3. Account for asynchronous controller updates
4. Account for in-band (for WAN) vs out-of-band
5. Model switch-to-controller and switch-to-switch latencies separately
6. Allow turning off certain parameters altogether (set the value to 0)
7. Account for other policies (ACL) and more complicated failure conditions
